            <p>In broad terms, a fruit is a structure of a plant that contains its seeds. The term has different
                meanings dependent on context. In non-technical usage, such as food preparation, fruit normally means
                the fleshy seed-associated structures of certain plants that are sweet and edible in the raw state, such
                as apples, oranges, grapes, strawberries, juniper berries and bananas.</p>

                such as vegetables, pods, nut, ears and cones. In biology (botany), a "fruit" is a part of a flowering
                plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries.</p>

            <h3>This is the first article heading</h3>

            <p>Often the botanical fruit is only part of the common fruit, or is merely adjacent to it. On the other
                hand, the botanical sense includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean
                pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, tomatoes, the section of a fungus that produces spores, and many more.
                However, there are several variants of the biological definition of fruit that emphasize different
                aspects of the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits.</p>

            <h3>This is the second article heading</h3>

            <p>Fruits (in either sense of the word) are the means by which many plants disseminate seeds. Most plants
                bearing edible fruits, in particular, coevolved with animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for
                seed dispersal and nutrition, respectively; in fact, many animals (including humans to some extent) have
                become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Fruits account for a substantial fraction of world's
                agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural
                and symbolic meanings.</p>

            <h3>This is the third article heading</h3>

            <p>Many fruits that, in a botanical sense, are true fruits are actually treated as vegetables in cooking and
                food preparation, because they are not particularly sweet. These culinary vegetables include cucurbits
                (e.g., squash, pumpkin, and cucumber), tomatoes, peas, beans, corn, eggplant, and sweet pepper. In
                addition, some spices, such as allspice and chilies, are fruits, botanically speaking. In contrast,
                occasionally a culinary "fruit" is not a true fruit in the botanical sense.</p>

            <p>Technically, a cereal grain is also a kind of fruit, a kind which is termed a caryopsis.</p>

            <p>However, the fruit wall is very thin, and is fused to the seed coat, so almost all of the edible grain is
                actually a seed. </p>

            <p>Therefore, cereal grains, such as corn, wheat and rice are better considered as edible seeds, although
                some references do list them as fruits.

            <p>Edible gymnosperm seeds are often misleadingly given fruit names, e.g., pine nuts, ginkgo nuts, and
                juniper berries.</p>
